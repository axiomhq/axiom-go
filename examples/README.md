# Examples

This directory contains examples that showcase the usage of Axiom Go. Each
example is a self-contained Go package that can be run with `go run`:

```shell
go run ./{example}
```

## Before you start

Axiom Go and the adapters automatically pick up their configuration from the
environment, if not otherwise specified. To learn more about configuration,
check the
[documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go).

To quickstart, export the environment variables below.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have the [Axiom CLI](github.com/axiomhq/cli) installed and are logged
> in, you can easily export most of the required environment variables:
>
>```shell
>eval $(axiom config export -f)
>```

### Required environment variables

- `AXIOM_TOKEN`: **API** or **Personal** token. Can be created under
  `Settings > API Tokens` or `Profile`. For security reasons it is advised to
  use an API token with minimal privileges only.
- `AXIOM_ORG_ID`: Organization identifier of the organization to (when using a
  personal token).
- `AXIOM_DATASET`: Dataset to use. Must exist prior to using it. You can use
  [Axiom CLI](github.com/axiomhq/cli) to create a dataset:
  `axiom dataset create`.
