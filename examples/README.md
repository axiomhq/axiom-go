# Examples

This directory contains examples that showcase the usage of Axiom Go. Each
example is a self-contained Go package that can be run with `go run`:

```shell
go run ./{example}
```

## Before you start

Axiom Go and the Adapters automatically pick up their configuration from the
environment, if not otherwise specified. To learn more about configuration,
check the [Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go).

To quickstart, export the environment variables below.

ðŸ’¡ _If you have the [Axiom CLI](https://direnv.net/) installed and are
logged in, you can easily export most of the required environment variables:_

```shell
eval $(axiom config export -f)
```

### When using Axiom Cloud

- `AXIOM_TOKEN`: **API** or **Personal Access** token. Can be created under
  `Settings > API Tokens` or `Profile`. For security reasons it is advised to
  use an API token with minimal privileges only.
- `AXIOM_ORG_ID`: Organization identifier of the organization to use on Axiom
  Cloud (when using a personal access token).
- `AXIOM_DATASET`: Dataset to use. Must exist prior to using it.

### When using Axiom Selfhost

- `AXIOM_URL`: URL of the Axiom deployment to use.
- `AXIOM_TOKEN`: **API** or **Personal Access** token. Can be created under
  `Settings > API Tokens` or `Profile`. For security reasons it is advised to
  use an API token with minimal privileges only.
- `AXIOM_DATASET`: Dataset to use. Must exist prior to using it.
