# Adapters

Adapters integrate Axiom Go into well known Go logging libraries. We currently
support these adapters right out of the box:

* [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus): `import "github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/logrus"`
* [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap): `import "github.com/axiomhq/axiom-go/adapters/zap"`
